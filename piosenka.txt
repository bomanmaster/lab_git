She's got a smile that it seems to me 
Reminds me of childhood memories 
Where everything 
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky 
Now and then when I see her face 
She takes me away to that special place 
And if I stared too long 
I'd probably break down and cry 
She's got eyes of the bluest skies 
As if they thought of rain 
I hate to look into those eyes
